# Sparse Dynamic Mode Decompositions (Sparse DMD)
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of Sparse Dynamic Mode Decompositions (Sparse DMD), a modification of the traditional DMD for extracting the modes that contribute the most in fluid flows.

# Running examples
## Run_example_1
In run_example, sparse DMD is applied to a synthetic example just to check the performance and number of nonzero amplitudes with respect to the sparsity parameter gamma.

## Run_example_2
In run_example_2, sparse DMD is applied to vorticity data of flow around a cylinder. Data is taken from chapter 2 of the DMD book available at [http://dmdbook.com/](http://dmdbook.com/). In addition to the performance and nonzero amplitudes, the modes chosen by sparse DMD are plotted with their residuals.

## Run_example_3
In run_example_3, sparse DMD is applied to the v velocity component of a 2D flow generated by a heated cylinder, where the fluid flow and heat transfer are analyzed using the Boussinesq approximation to model and solve the buoyancy problem.
